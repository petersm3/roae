# Project History

An honest narrative of how the enumeration analysis evolved — including missteps, corrections, and the iterative process of discovery. Written for anyone curious about how computational research actually works, as opposed to the clean narrative of published results.

## Prelude — Before April 10, 2026

The project began as a mathematical analysis of the [King Wen sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_sequence), built iteratively with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (Anthropic). What started as exploring a known structural property grew into a comprehensive computational investigation.

**[roae.py](roae.py) — the analysis engine.** A single-file Python program (no external dependencies) was built to approach the King Wen sequence from every mathematical angle available. It grew to include 28 statistical analyses: pair structure, difference wave, trigrams, complements, entropy, autocorrelation, Markov chains, FFT spectral analysis, Gray code comparison, Monte Carlo constraint testing, and more. Each analysis includes appropriate null models and statistical caveats.

**Key discoveries during this phase:**
- **Trigram name swap bug:** Gen/Xun/Dui were cyclically swapped in the original code. Fixed by correcting the trigram_names dict.
- **Complement distance direction:** Originally claimed King Wen "maximizes" complement distance. Discovered this was a circular filtering artifact — KW actually *minimizes* (3.9th percentile). Corrected across all documentation.
- **XOR regularity is a theorem, not a finding:** The 7 unique XOR products in KW's pairs are a mathematical consequence of ANY reverse/inverse pairing of 6-bit values, not a property of King Wen specifically. Proved and documented.
- **Null model test:** Applying the same constraint-extraction methodology to random pair-constrained sequences produces apparent uniqueness in 9 out of 10 cases. This means the constraint framework makes almost any sequence appear uniquely determined — a critical methodological caveat.
- **"97%/3%" framing was misleading.** Replaced with more honest descriptions of what the data actually showed.

**[solve.py](solve.py) — the first constraint solver.** A Python backtracking solver was built to test whether the mathematical constraints could reconstruct King Wen from scratch. It found 438 valid orderings from a partial search (limited by Python's speed). Based on this small sample, several claims were made that would later be invalidated by larger-scale enumeration.

**Six rounds of scientific review.** The documentation was iteratively attacked from mathematical and scientific perspectives — testing every claim for rigor, checking null models, correcting statistical framing, and adding appropriate caveats. This adversarial review process caught the complement distance error, the XOR theorem, and the null model caveat.

**Documentation suite.** [SOLVE-SUMMARY.md](SOLVE-SUMMARY.md) (plain-language), [SOLVE.md](SOLVE.md) (technical), [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md) (formal), [CRITIQUE.md](CRITIQUE.md) (known limitations), [MCKENNA.md](MCKENNA.md) (relationship to [Timewave Zero theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna#Novelty_theory_and_Timewave_Zero)), and [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) (newcomer introduction) were all written during this phase.

## Day 1 — April 10, 2026

**Starting point:** The ROAE project had a Python analysis engine ([roae.py](roae.py)) with 28 statistical analyses of the King Wen sequence, and a Python constraint solver ([solve.py](solve.py)) that had found 438 valid orderings from a partial search. Based on those 438 solutions, the documentation claimed:

- "23 of 32 pair positions are locked" (identical across all solutions)
- "2 adjacency constraints uniquely determine King Wen"
- A "complete generative recipe" existed

These claims would all turn out to be wrong.

**The C solver:** To explore the solution space more thoroughly, a multi-threaded C solver ([solve.c](solve.c)) was built. The initial version was single-threaded, then rewritten with pthreads to use multiple cores. Early versions had several bugs:

- **Segfault at 40M solutions:** `realloc` overflow when the solution buffer doubled past 1GB. Fixed by switching to a fixed-size hash table.
- **Hash-only comparison:** The first hash table used FNV-1a hash comparison only (no key verification), giving ~1-3% false positive rate. Later replaced with full 64-byte key comparison for zero false positives.
- **SSH process killed on disconnect:** The solver died when the SSH session closed. Fixed by launching from a quick SSH command with `nohup`.
- **`signal()` handler reset bug:** SIGTERM handler only fired once because `signal()` resets after invocation on Linux. Replaced with `sigaction()`.

**First Azure deployment:** An F64als_v6 VM (64 cores, 128 GB RAM) was deployed in westus2 to run the solver. Initial cost estimate was $1.97/hr — this would later turn out to be wrong (actual on-demand price: $3.87/hr).

## Day 2 — April 11, 2026

**The 4-hour run that crashed:** A 4-hour run on the F64 explored 18.7 trillion nodes across 56 threads. All 56 branches hit the time limit — none completed. But the process crashed during the merge phase with no output. The cause: **integer overflow** in `sol_offset * 64` — at 78.5M entries, the multiplication exceeded 32-bit int range, causing a buffer overwrite and segfault.

The crash destroyed all in-memory analytics and solutions. However, checkpoint.txt survived with per-branch data, revealing:

- The search tree was far larger than estimated
- Some branches had zero C3-valid solutions (potential "dead" branches)
- One branch (pair 30) had overflowed its hash table (4M entries)

**Critical bug in checkpointing:** All 56 branches were marked "complete" in the checkpoint — but they were actually interrupted by the time limit. The checkpoint code didn't distinguish between "finished naturally" and "stopped by timeout." On resume, all branches would have been skipped. Fixed by adding COMPLETE vs INTERRUPTED status labels.

**The 1-hour run:** After fixing the integer overflow, a 1-hour run on 56 threads found 20,110,129 unique pair orderings. This was the first successful large-scale result. Key revelations:

- **Only 1 position is locked, not 23.** Position 1 (Creative/Receptive) is the only universally locked position. The "23 locked" claim was an artifact of the 438-solution sample, which came from a single search branch.
- **Millions of solutions exist, not thousands.** Three orders of magnitude more than previously documented.
- 24 of 56 branches appeared dead (zero C3-valid solutions).

All documentation was rewritten to reflect these revised findings. The narrative changed from "6 rules + 2 adjacencies = unique King Wen" to "5 constraints narrow 10^89 to at least 20 million; uniqueness is an open question."

**Visualization:** [visualize.py](visualize.py) was written to generate PCA scatter plots of the solution space. The initial version had Python loops that would have taken hours on 20M+ solutions. Rewritten with numpy vectorization and subsampling for plots.

## Day 3 — April 12, 2026

**The 10T reproducible run:** The solver was enhanced with a deterministic node limit (`SOLVE_NODE_LIMIT`) for reproducible results. See [solve.c](solve.c) architecture comments for full design documentation. Unlike time limits, node limits produce identical output on any hardware.

Initial implementation checked the node limit globally (total across all threads), but this made the sha256 depend on thread count. Redesigned to use **per-branch node budgets** (`node_limit / n_branches`), checked per-branch in the backtracker. Each branch explores exactly the same nodes regardless of how many threads are running.

Verified: 1-thread and 2-thread runs produce identical sha256.

**The cost discovery:** Azure pricing API revealed the F64 on-demand cost was $3.87/hr, not the $1.97 originally estimated. Spot pricing was $0.79/hr. Requested and received spot quota increase to 64 cores.

**10T run results (56-branch mode):** 9.99 trillion nodes explored, 31,630,621 unique orderings found. King Wen confirmed present. sha256: `c43f251fb9b66de0237c35ad78b5236011cb9886644ce73437138b50d2f2104d`.

**The tail problem:** The last 4 branches (all "dead" — zero solutions) ran on single cores for 90+ minutes while 60 cores sat idle. The 10T run took 3h 48m instead of ~2h because of this load imbalance.

**Solutions.bin lost:** When the F64 VM was deallocated, the 1-hour run's solutions.bin was lost — it was on the VM's disk and the monitor hadn't copied it. The 10T run's solutions.bin was properly preserved. Lesson: always copy ALL output files before deallocating.

**Minimum constraint analysis:** Using the 31.6M solution dataset:

- **4 boundary constraints uniquely determine King Wen** (not 2 as previously claimed). Boundaries 25 and 27 (the original C6/C7) eliminate 99.6% but leave 1,055 survivors. Boundaries 1 and 21 eliminate the rest.
- **4 is the proven minimum.** Exhaustive testing of all 31 singles (31), pairs (465), triples (4,495), and quadruples (31,465) confirmed this. Only 4 of 31,465 quadruples work.
- **3 boundaries are mandatory** (21, 25, 27). The 4th can be any of boundaries 1-4. The constraint structure is almost fully determined.
- **No scalar property uniquely identifies King Wen.** No complement distance, position constraint, or edit distance pattern distinguishes KW. The uniqueness is irreducibly combinatorial.

**Dead branch correction:** 4 branches classified as "dead" in the 1-hour run (pairs 13, 16, 21, 26) were found to be live in the 10T run — they had deep, hard-to-find solutions. "Estimated dead" is the correct label.

**Self-complementary proof:** Constructive proof that all self-complementary pairs at position 2 produce valid orderings. 7 concrete examples extracted and verified. The budget analysis shows why: self-complementary pairs consume from the loosest budget category (distance-6).

**Super-pair anomaly:** Position 20 has the largest gap between pair match (27.5%) and super-pair match (51.2%). Complement pairs are interchangeable at this position — the constraint operates at the super-pair level.

**Neighbor analysis:** 14 solutions differ from King Wen by exactly 2 positions (edit distance 2). All are mutual pair swaps in positions 21-32. 3 of 14 swap structurally identical pairs.

**The 3,030 sub-branch rewrite:** The normal mode was rewritten to enumerate all ~3,030 depth-2 sub-branches instead of 56 depth-1 branches. This eliminates the tail problem: all cores stay busy until near the end.

Each sub-branch writes solutions to a per-sub-branch file (`sub_P2_O2.bin`), the hash table is cleared, and the final merge reads all files. This ensures thread-count-independent output — the sha256 is the same regardless of how many cores run the solver.

**The 10T run with 3,030 mode:** Completed in 2h 6m (vs 3h 48m for the old mode). But King Wen was NOT found — the per-sub-branch budget (3.3B nodes) was too shallow. The old 56-branch mode gave 178B per branch, deep enough to find KW. The 3,030 mode spreads the budget 54x thinner.

This meant the 4-boundary analysis was invalid on this dataset. The old 31.6M dataset remained the reference for analysis.

**100T run deployed:** To get a dataset with KW present AND 3,030-mode load balancing, a 100T run was started on a spot F64 ($0.79/hr). See [enumeration/LEADERBOARD.md](enumeration/LEADERBOARD.md) for tracking. Per-sub-branch budget: 33B — 10x more than the failed 10T run. Estimated time: ~20 hours.

**The shift pattern:** Across all 31.6M solutions, positions 3-19 have EXACTLY 2 possible pairs: King Wen's pair or the pair shifted by one position. Zero exceptions. This is universal, not a sampling artifact.

**Position 2 determines positions 3-19:** Within each branch, positions 3-19 have exactly ONE configuration — empirically observed across all 16 live branches in the 31.6M dataset (zero exceptions). Formal proof is partial: 16 of 31 branches proved by budget constraints alone; 12 branches require the complement distance constraint (C3) to eliminate 17 of 18 budget-feasible alternatives (full proof running). The choice at position 2 deterministically locks the next 17 positions through budget constraint propagation. All freedom in the King Wen sequence is in positions 20-32 — only 13 pair positions are genuinely free.

## Current state

The project has a reproducible 31.6M-solution dataset (sha256: `c43f251f...d2f2104d`, reproducible with `SOLVE_NODE_LIMIT=10000000000000`), a [proven-minimum 4-boundary uniqueness result](SOLVE.md#why-4-boundaries--not-fewer), and a structural understanding of the [constraint cascade](SOLVE.md#the-shift-pattern-positions-3-19-have-exactly-2-options-universal) (position 2 → positions 3-19). A 100T run is in progress on a spot instance to produce a larger dataset with the 3,030 sub-branch architecture. The [formal proof](SOLVE.md#partial-formal-proof) that the cascade is deterministic (not just observed) is partially complete — 16 of 31 branches proved, with the full C3-incorporating proof running.
