## Summary

A single-file Python analysis engine (no external dependencies) that approaches the King Wen sequence from nearly every mathematical angle available. It started as a script verifying a known structural property of the sequence and grew into a comprehensive toolkit for studying the combinatorial structure of an ancient Chinese ordering system.

## Example

See [example output](example/README.md) for full program output.

## Observations

The [King Wen sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_sequence) is traditionally attributed to [King Wen of Zhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou) (~1000 BCE). It is not random, but it's also not optimized for any single obvious metric. The evidence stacks up:

- **The pair structure is perfect** — every one of the 32 pairs is a reverse or inverse, and zero random permutations out of 10,000 achieved this.
- **The no-5-line property is real but not astronomically rare** — about 1 in 550 random orderings share it. Notable, not miraculous.
- **Combined constraints are extraordinary** — zero random permutations satisfy both the pair structure AND the no-5 property together (95% upper bound: less than 1 in 3,333).
- **It's more structured than random** — entropy sits at the 13th percentile, meaning it's more ordered than 87% of random permutations.
- **The wave has no detectable periodicity** — autocorrelation drops off immediately, and the FFT shows no dominant frequency, though with only N=63 data points the statistical power to detect weak periodicity is limited.
- **The Markov transition matrix is not unusual** — a permutation test shows King Wen's transition structure is at the 43rd percentile, indistinguishable from random orderings. Apparent patterns (e.g., "6 is always followed by 2") are based on small samples and are not statistically significant.
- **The path length is typical for its structure** — compared against unconstrained random orderings, King Wen appears rough (97th percentile, 3.35x a Gray code). But compared against the correct null model (random orderings that also satisfy the pair constraint), it's at the 29th percentile — completely typical.
- **The XOR algebra is clean** — 32 pairs produce only ~12 unique products, suggesting the pairing system has deeper algebraic regularity.
- **King Wen is unique among known orderings** — neither the [Fu Xi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shao_Yong) (binary) ordering nor the [Mawangdui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawangdui_Silk_Texts) silk manuscript ordering avoids 5-line transitions.

The picture that emerges is of a sequence designed under multiple simultaneous constraints — pair relationships and avoidance of certain transitions — none of which individually are impossible by chance, but which together are vanishingly unlikely. The designers (whoever they were, [~3000 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou)) appear to have been working with combinatorial rules, even if they wouldn't have described them in mathematical terms.

Note: with 28 analyses, some results will appear unusual by chance alone. The strongest findings (pair structure, combined constraints) survive multiple comparison correction. Weaker findings should be interpreted with caution. See [CRITIQUE.md](CRITIQUE.md) for known limitations.

See [MCKENNA.md](MCKENNA.md) for how these findings relate to [Terence McKenna's Timewave Zero theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna#Novelty_theory_and_Timewave_Zero).
