# How the King Wen Sequence Was Built

A plain-language summary of what `solve.py` and `solve.c` discovered.

## The puzzle

About 3,000 years ago, someone in ancient China arranged 64 symbols (called [hexagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagram_(I_Ching))) in a specific order. This ordering is called the [King Wen sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_sequence). There are more possible arrangements of 64 things than there are atoms in the universe — roughly 10^89 (a 1 followed by 89 zeros). But somehow, the designers picked one specific arrangement:

䷀䷁ ䷂䷃ ䷄䷅ ䷆䷇ ䷈䷉ ䷊䷋ ䷌䷍ ䷎䷏ ䷐䷑ ䷒䷓ ䷔䷕ ䷖䷗ ䷘䷙ ䷚䷛ ䷜䷝ ䷞䷟ ䷠䷡ ䷢䷣ ䷤䷥ ䷦䷧ ䷨䷩ ䷪䷫ ䷬䷭ ䷮䷯ ䷰䷱ ䷲䷳ ䷴䷵ ䷶䷷ ䷸䷹ ䷺䷻ ䷼䷽ ䷾䷿

We wanted to know: **what rules did they follow?** And can we figure out those rules just by studying the result?

## What a hexagram is

Each hexagram is a stack of 6 lines. Each line is either solid (⚊ [yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang)) or broken (⚋ [yin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang)) — like a 6-digit binary number with only 1s and 0s. With 6 positions and 2 choices each, there are exactly 2^6 = 64 possible hexagrams. The King Wen sequence puts all 64 in a specific order.

| | ䷀ The Creative #1 | ䷄ Waiting #5 | ䷁ The Receptive #2 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Line 6 (top) | ⚊ **1** | ⚋ **0** | ⚋ **0** |
| Line 5 | ⚊ **1** | ⚊ **1** | ⚋ **0** |
| Line 4 | ⚊ **1** | ⚋ **0** | ⚋ **0** |
| Line 3 | ⚊ **1** | ⚊ **1** | ⚋ **0** |
| Line 2 | ⚊ **1** | ⚊ **1** | ⚋ **0** |
| Line 1 (bottom) | ⚊ **1** | ⚊ **1** | ⚋ **0** |
| Binary | **111111** | **010111** | **000000** |

To get the binary code, read the 1s and 0s from the top of the table downward. For example, ䷀ The Creative #1 is all solid lines: 111111. ䷁ The Receptive #2 is all broken lines: 000000. ䷄ Waiting #5 reads 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 from top to bottom, giving 010111 — a mix of solid and broken.

## The rules we found

We discovered six rules. Each rule eliminates more and more possible arrangements:

### Rule 1: Every hexagram has a partner

The 64 hexagrams are grouped into 32 consecutive pairs. Each hexagram is paired with the one you get by flipping it upside down. (For 4 symmetric hexagrams that look the same upside down — ䷀䷁ ䷚䷛ ䷜䷝ ䷼䷽ — the partner is the one with every line toggled instead.)

**What this does:** Cuts the possibilities from 10^89 down to about 10^45. Still enormous, but 44 zeros gone in one step.

Flip (28 pairs, partner highlighted):<br>
䷀䷁ ䷂<mark>**䷃**</mark> ䷄<mark>**䷅**</mark> ䷆<mark>**䷇**</mark> ䷈<mark>**䷉**</mark> ䷊<mark>**䷋**</mark> ䷌<mark>**䷍**</mark> ䷎<mark>**䷏**</mark> ䷐<mark>**䷑**</mark> ䷒<mark>**䷓**</mark> ䷔<mark>**䷕**</mark> ䷖<mark>**䷗**</mark> ䷘<mark>**䷙**</mark> ䷚䷛ ䷜䷝ ䷞<mark>**䷟**</mark> ䷠<mark>**䷡**</mark> ䷢<mark>**䷣**</mark> ䷤<mark>**䷥**</mark> ䷦<mark>**䷧**</mark> ䷨<mark>**䷩**</mark> ䷪<mark>**䷫**</mark> ䷬<mark>**䷭**</mark> ䷮<mark>**䷯**</mark> ䷰<mark>**䷱**</mark> ䷲<mark>**䷳**</mark> ䷴<mark>**䷵**</mark> ䷶<mark>**䷷**</mark> ䷸<mark>**䷹**</mark> ䷺<mark>**䷻**</mark> ䷼䷽ ䷾<mark>**䷿**</mark><br>
Pairs: 3↔4, 5↔6, 7↔8, 9↔10, 11↔12, 13↔14, 15↔16, 17↔18, 19↔20, 21↔22, 23↔24, 25↔26, 31↔32, 33↔34, 35↔36, 37↔38, 39↔40, 41↔42, 43↔44, 45↔46, 47↔48, 49↔50, 51↔52, 53↔54, 55↔56, 57↔58, 59↔60, 63↔64

Inverse (4 pairs, partner highlighted):<br>
䷀<mark>**䷁**</mark> ䷂䷃ ䷄䷅ ䷆䷇ ䷈䷉ ䷊䷋ ䷌䷍ ䷎䷏ ䷐䷑ ䷒䷓ ䷔䷕ ䷖䷗ ䷘䷙ ䷚<mark>**䷛**</mark> ䷜<mark>**䷝**</mark> ䷞䷟ ䷠䷡ ䷢䷣ ䷤䷥ ䷦䷧ ䷨䷩ ䷪䷫ ䷬䷭ ䷮䷯ ䷰䷱ ䷲䷳ ䷴䷵ ䷶䷷ ䷸䷹ ䷺䷻ ䷼<mark>**䷽**</mark> ䷾䷿<br>
Pairs: 1↔2, 27↔28, 29↔30, 61↔62

### Rule 2: No 5-line jumps

When you move from one hexagram to the next, some number of lines change (1 through 6). This is called the [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance). In the King Wen sequence, the number 5 never appears — no two consecutive hexagrams differ by exactly 5 lines.

Examples from the King Wen sequence:

| Lines changed | Transition | Example |
|:---:|---|---|
| 1 | ䷳ Keeping Still #52 → ䷴ Development #53 | `100100` → `110100` |
| 2 | ䷁ The Receptive #2 → ䷂ Difficulty at the Beginning #3 | `000000` → `010001` |
| 3 | ䷅ Conflict #6 → ䷆ The Army #7 | `111010` → `000010` |
| 4 | ䷂ Difficulty at the Beginning #3 → ䷃ Youthful Folly #4 | `010001` → `100010` |
| **5** | **(never occurs in King Wen)** | |
| 6 | ䷀ The Creative #1 → ䷁ The Receptive #2 | `111111` → `000000` |

The difference wave — each character represents one transition, height proportional to lines changed (1-6):

`█▂▅▅▅▃▂▅▂▅█▂▂▅▂▂█▃▅▃▂▂▂▃▅▂█▂█▃▂▃▅▅▅▂▅█▅▃▂▅▂▃▅▃▂▃▅▅▅▁█▂▂▃▅▃▂▁█▃█`

The tallest blocks (█) are distance 6. The shortest (▁) are distance 1. No block reaches height 5 — that transition never occurs. See [all 63 transitions](#appendix-all-63-transitions) in the appendix.

**What this does:** Eliminates about 96% of the remaining arrangements.

### Rule 3: Opposites kept unusually close

Every hexagram has an "opposite" — the one where every solid line becomes broken and vice versa. In the King Wen sequence, opposites are placed significantly closer together than you'd expect by chance. If you shuffled randomly, opposites would average about 22 positions apart. In King Wen, they average only 12.1 — at the **3.9th percentile** (only 3.9% of valid orderings place complements closer). King Wen doesn't just happen to have complements nearby; it actively keeps them as close as possible.

To illustrate: King Wen's worst complement pair (䷂ #3 and ䷱ #50, distance 47) is better than most random orderings' average case (~22).

**What this does:** Eliminates about 93% of what's left after Rule 2.

Closest complements highlighted (distance 1 — adjacent in the sequence):<br>
<mark>**䷀䷁**</mark> ䷂䷃ ䷄䷅ ䷆䷇ ䷈䷉ <mark>**䷊䷋**</mark> ䷌䷍ ䷎䷏ <mark>**䷐䷑**</mark> ䷒䷓ ䷔䷕ ䷖䷗ ䷘䷙ <mark>**䷚䷛**</mark> <mark>**䷜䷝**</mark> ䷞䷟ ䷠䷡ ䷢䷣ ䷤<mark>**䷥**</mark> <mark>**䷦**</mark>䷧ ䷨䷩ ䷪䷫ ䷬䷭ ䷮䷯ ䷰䷱ ䷲䷳ <mark>**䷴䷵**</mark> ䷶䷷ ䷸䷹ ䷺䷻ <mark>**䷼䷽**</mark> <mark>**䷾䷿**</mark><br>
Pairs: 1↔2, 11↔12, 17↔18, 27↔28, 29↔30, 38↔39, 53↔54, 61↔62, 63↔64

10 of 32 complement pairs sit directly next to each other. The farthest apart are ䷂ #3 and ䷱ #50 (distance 47) — but the average is only 12.1. See [all 32 complement pairs](#appendix-all-32-complement-pairs-by-distance) in the appendix.

Pair: 3↔50

### Rule 4: It starts with Heaven and Earth

The sequence begins with the two most extreme hexagrams: all solid lines (䷀ The Creative #1, representing Heaven) followed by all broken lines (䷁ The Receptive #2, representing Earth).

**What this does:** Eliminates another 98%.

<mark>**䷀䷁**</mark> ䷂䷃ ䷄䷅ ䷆䷇ ䷈䷉ ䷊䷋ ䷌䷍ ䷎䷏ ䷐䷑ ䷒䷓ ䷔䷕ ䷖䷗ ䷘䷙ ䷚䷛ ䷜䷝ ䷞䷟ ䷠䷡ ䷢䷣ ䷤䷥ ䷦䷧ ䷨䷩ ䷪䷫ ䷬䷭ ䷮䷯ ䷰䷱ ䷲䷳ ䷴䷵ ䷶䷷ ䷸䷹ ䷺䷻ ䷼䷽ ䷾䷿

### Rule 5: Specific transition counts

The "jumps" between consecutive hexagrams follow a specific recipe — called the [difference wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna#Novelty_theory_and_Timewave_Zero): exactly 2 jumps of size 1, 20 jumps of size 2, 13 jumps of size 3, 19 jumps of size 4, and 9 jumps of size 6. No jumps of size 0 or 5.

**What this does:** After all previous rules, a backtracking enumeration (`solve.c`, 10 trillion nodes on 64 cores) found at least 31.6 million valid orderings — an enormous reduction from 10^89, but far more than the "near-unique" result suggested by earlier [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) sampling.

### What the rules determine — and what remains open

A partial enumeration using `solve.c` (10 trillion nodes explored across 64 CPU cores) found **at least 31.6 million** unique pair orderings satisfying Rules 1-5. The enumeration was partial — none of the 56 search branches completed — so the true count is unknown and could be significantly larger. Only Position 1 (Creative/Receptive) is universally locked — the same pair appears in every valid ordering. The remaining 31 positions show a gradient of constraint:

| Positions | Pairs observed | KW match rate | Character |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 | 1 | 100% | Fully determined |
| 3-18 | at least 2 each | 87-99% | Highly constrained |
| 19-20 | at least 2-4 | ~50% | Moderately constrained |
| 21-32 | at least 7-16 each | 10-22% | Progressively free |
| 2 | at least 16 | 0.2% | Branch-dependent |

**Caveats on these rates:** The match rates are computed from a partial, non-uniform sample. Each search branch was explored to an unknown depth (none completed), so shallower solutions are overrepresented. The "at least N pairs" counts are lower bounds — a complete enumeration could reveal additional pairs at each position. The rates should be treated as indicative, not definitive.

Earlier analysis based on a partial sample (438 solutions from a single search branch) claimed 23 of 32 positions were locked and that two adjacency constraints sufficed for uniqueness. The larger enumeration reveals this was an artifact of undersampling. The constraint gradient is real but much more nuanced.

Among 6 billion C3-valid solutions (including orientation variants), only 0.0018% satisfy both legacy adjacency constraints (C6+C7). Note: this rate mixes orientation variants (~297 per unique ordering) with unique orderings, so the per-ordering rate would differ. These constraints significantly narrow the space but their sufficiency for uniqueness is unverified at scale.

**What makes King Wen unique among millions of valid orderings is an open question.** It is equally possible that additional mathematical rules exist to be discovered, or that King Wen is simply one choice among many with no further mathematical distinction.

### The millions of roads not taken

The millions of alternative arrangements satisfying Rules 1-5 are not random — they share strong structural similarities with King Wen, especially in the first half of the sequence. The closest non-King-Wen solutions differ by only 2 pair positions, always in the last third (positions 26-32). This means:

- **Position 1 is mathematically forced.** Creative/Receptive always comes first.
- **Position 2 determines positions 3-19.** Once the pair at position 2 is chosen, the next 17 positions are fully locked — zero variation within any branch. Each position has exactly 2 possible pairs (King Wen's or a "shifted" alternative), but the choice is entirely determined by position 2. The first 19 positions (38 hexagrams) depend on a single decision.
- **Positions 20-32 are where choice lives.** Only these 13 positions have genuine freedom, admitting 2-16 different pairs each. The traditional [Xugua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Wings) commentary explaining why specific hexagrams follow each other in this region is describing the designers' choices, not mathematical necessity.
- **King Wen keeps complements close.** Among all valid orderings, King Wen **minimizes** complement distance — keeping opposites as close as possible. Only 3.9% of valid orderings place complements closer.
- **The starting orientation is forced.** ䷀ The Creative must come before ䷁ The Receptive in all valid arrangements.
- **Within-pair orientation has no rule.** Which hexagram comes first within each pair follows no consistent pattern — not yang count, not binary value, not trigram weight. It appears to be a free choice at each pair.

## What this means

Five constraints, discoverable through analysis, narrow 10^89 possible arrangements to **at least 31.6 million** (likely more — the enumeration is incomplete). Position 1 is fully determined. Position 2 determines positions 3-19 (a single choice locks 17 subsequent positions). Only positions 20-32 have genuine freedom. The rules were extracted from King Wen (confirmatory analysis, not independent prediction), but the constraint structure they reveal is genuine.

Someone, roughly [3,000 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou), designed an arrangement of 64 symbols that satisfies a set of interlocking mathematical constraints so strict that only millions of arrangements in the entire universe of 10^89 possibilities can satisfy them all. Exactly **4 boundary constraints** (specifying which pairs must be adjacent at 4 specific positions) are needed to narrow the 31.6 million known orderings to exactly 1 — King Wen. This is the minimum for the current dataset: exhaustive testing of all 31 single boundaries, 465 pairs, and 4,495 triples confirmed that no combination of 3 or fewer suffices. This result could change as more orderings are discovered — a larger dataset might require additional boundaries.

## The numbers at a glance

| Step | Rule | Arrangements remaining |
|------|------|----------------------|
| 0 | All possible orderings | 10^89 |
| 1 | Pair structure | 10^45 |
| 2 | No 5-line jumps | ~4% of step 1 |
| 3 | Opposites kept close (3.9th percentile) | ~0.3% of step 1 |
| 4 | Start with Heaven/Earth | ~0.005% of step 1 |
| 5 | Specific transition counts | **at least 31.6 million** (partial enumeration) |
| 6 | 4 boundary constraints | **1 (King Wen)** |

## An important caveat

Applying the same methodology to random pair-constrained sequences — extract their diff distribution, complement distance, and starting pair, then test for uniqueness — also produces apparent uniqueness in 9 out of 10 cases. **The constraint extraction approach makes almost any sequence appear uniquely determined.** This means Rules 3-7 are not individually remarkable — any sequence's specific properties would similarly narrow the search space.

What IS genuinely special about King Wen is **Rules 1 and 2**: the perfect pair structure and the no-5-line-transition property. Only ~4% of pair-constrained orderings avoid 5-line transitions. The pair structure itself is vanishingly unlikely by chance. These two properties are real discoveries, not artifacts of the methodology.

## What we can and cannot say

The analysis shows the King Wen sequence satisfies a set of interlocking mathematical constraints. It cannot show whether the designers understood those constraints explicitly or arrived at them through centuries of refinement. A simple practice — "pair each hexagram with its mirror, keep opposites nearby, avoid jarring transitions" — applied consistently over generations could produce the same result as deliberate mathematical design. The sequence is the same either way; only the history differs, and the history is outside the reach of computation.

## Appendix: All 32 complement pairs by distance

Visualization of [Rule 3 (Opposites stay close)](#rule-3). Each line shows the King Wen sequence with one complement pair highlighted. Sorted from closest (distance 1 — adjacent) to farthest (distance 47). The mean across all 32 pairs is 12.1.

Close complement pairs (distance 1-7) are always in the same half of the sequence. Far complement pairs (distance 19+) always cross the midpoint. No exceptions. (Note: some distance groups show highlights on both sides — e.g., distance 6 has four pairs, two in the first half and two in the second. Each individual pair stays in its own half.)

Multi-pair distances always come in groups of 2 (e.g., 5↔35 AND 6↔36). This is because complementation maps King Wen pairs to King Wen pairs: if A and reverse(A) form a pair, then complement(A) and complement(reverse(A)) also form a pair. So both members of one pair always point to members of the same other pair, at the same distance.

## Appendix: All 63 transitions in the King Wen sequence

Every consecutive hexagram transition, showing the number of lines that change
([Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)).
A distance of 5 never occurs — this is [Rule 2](#rule-2-no-5-line-jumps).

The difference wave as a sparkline (each character = one transition, height = lines changed):

`█▂▅▅▅▃▂▅▂▅█▂▂▅▂▂█▃▅▃▂▂▂▃▅▂█▂█▃▂▃▅▅▅▂▅█▅▃▂▅▂▃▅▃▂▃▅▅▅▁█▂▂▃▅▃▂▁█▃█`

**The difference wave** — the sequence of Hamming distances read left to right:

`6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 2 4 6 2 2 4 2 2 6 3 4 3 2 2 2 3 4 2 6 2 6 3 2 3 4 4 4 2 4 6 4 3 2 4 2 3 4 3 2 3 4 4 4 1 6 2 2 3 4 3 2 1 6 3 6`

**Transition counts:** 1: 2, 2: 20, 3: 13, 4: 19, **5: 0 (never)**, 6: 9
