# How the King Wen Sequence Was Built

Older figures (742M, 31.6M) were invalidated by bug forensics and appear only as historical references in [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md). A key **new finding** from the 2026-04-19 analyze runs: the mandatory-boundaries claim `{25, 27}` is partition-stable (holds at both d2 and d3); the broader "{25,27} ∪ one-of-{2,3} ∪ one-of-{21,22}" phrasing is **d2-specific** (d3 shows 8 working 4-subsets with different interchangeable slots). See updated boundaries section below.

> **What this analysis does and does not show.** The **robust findings** — that King Wen has perfect pair structure, avoids 5-line transitions, and minimizes complement distance — are properties that are independently rare or unique in random permutations. The **"4 boundaries uniquely determine King Wen" result**, however, is a property of the **constraint-extraction methodology**, not evidence of King Wen's inherent uniqueness beyond those robust findings. A null-model test (see [CRITIQUE.md](CRITIQUE.md)) found that applying the same methodology — extract distance distribution + starting pair + specific boundaries from a random pair-constrained sequence, then check uniqueness — produces apparent "uniqueness" for 9/10 random sequences. So the 4-boundary uniqueness is true of King Wen *within this methodological frame* but would be equally true of many other pair-constrained sequences if treated the same way. Keep this distinction in mind as you read.

A plain-language summary of what `solve.py` and `solve.c` compute. Several of the core observations (the pair structure C1, the no-5-line-transition property C2) have been noted in prior literature — see [CITATIONS.md](CITATIONS.md) for credits. ROAE's specific contribution is **exhaustive enumeration** of solutions under the conjoined constraint system, **partition-invariant reproducibility** of the canonical counts, and a **seven-family null-model framework** testing how the King Wen structure compares to structured and unstructured permutation families.

## The puzzle

About 3,000 years ago, someone in ancient China arranged 64 symbols (called [hexagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagram_(I_Ching))) in a specific order. This ordering is called the [King Wen sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_sequence). There are more possible arrangements of 64 things than there are atoms in the universe — roughly 10^89 (a 1 followed by 89 zeros). But somehow, the designers picked one specific arrangement:

䷀䷁ ䷂䷃ ䷄䷅ ䷆䷇ ䷈䷉ ䷊䷋ ䷌䷍ ䷎䷏ ䷐䷑ ䷒䷓ ䷔䷕ ䷖䷗ ䷘䷙ ䷚䷛ ䷜䷝ ䷞䷟ ䷠䷡ ䷢䷣ ䷤䷥ ䷦䷧ ䷨䷩ ䷪䷫ ䷬䷭ ䷮䷯ ䷰䷱ ䷲䷳ ䷴䷵ ䷶䷷ ䷸䷹ ䷺䷻ ䷼䷽ ䷾䷿

We wanted to know: **what rules did they follow?** And can we figure out those rules just by studying the result?

## What a hexagram is

Each hexagram is a stack of 6 lines. Each line is either solid (⚊ [yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang)) or broken (⚋ [yin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang)) — like a 6-digit binary number with only 1s and 0s. With 6 positions and 2 choices each, there are exactly 2^6 = 64 possible hexagrams. The King Wen sequence puts all 64 in a specific order.

| | ䷀ The Creative #1 | ䷄ Waiting #5 | ䷁ The Receptive #2 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Line 6 (top) | ⚊ **1** | ⚋ **0** | ⚋ **0** |
| Line 5 | ⚊ **1** | ⚊ **1** | ⚋ **0** |
| Line 4 | ⚊ **1** | ⚋ **0** | ⚋ **0** |
| Line 3 | ⚊ **1** | ⚊ **1** | ⚋ **0** |
| Line 2 | ⚊ **1** | ⚊ **1** | ⚋ **0** |
| Line 1 (bottom) | ⚊ **1** | ⚊ **1** | ⚋ **0** |
| Binary | **111111** | **010111** | **000000** |

To get the binary code, read the 1s and 0s from the top of the table downward. For example, ䷀ The Creative #1 is all solid lines: 111111. ䷁ The Receptive #2 is all broken lines: 000000. ䷄ Waiting #5 reads 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 from top to bottom, giving 010111 — a mix of solid and broken.

## The rules we found

Six rules, each eliminating more and more possible arrangements. Rules 1 and 2 are known in prior literature (Rule 1 from I Ching scholarship / Cook 2006; Rule 2 from Terence & Dennis McKenna's *The Invisible Landscape*, 1975); Rules 3–6 are formalized and quantified here. See [CITATIONS.md](CITATIONS.md).

### Rule 1: Every hexagram has a partner

The 64 hexagrams are grouped into 32 consecutive pairs. Each hexagram is paired with the one you get by flipping it upside down. (For 4 symmetric hexagrams that look the same upside down — ䷀䷁ ䷚䷛ ䷜䷝ ䷼䷽ — the partner is the one with every line toggled instead.)

**What this does:** Cuts the possibilities from 10^89 down to about 10^45. Still enormous, but 44 zeros gone in one step.

䷀䷁ ䷂<mark>**䷃**</mark> ䷄<mark>**䷅**</mark> ䷆<mark>**䷇**</mark> ䷈<mark>**䷉**</mark> ䷊<mark>**䷋**</mark> ䷌<mark>**䷍**</mark> ䷎<mark>**䷏**</mark> ䷐<mark>**䷑**</mark> ䷒<mark>**䷓**</mark> ䷔<mark>**䷕**</mark> ䷖<mark>**䷗**</mark> ䷘<mark>**䷙**</mark> ䷚䷛ ䷜䷝ ䷞<mark>**䷟**</mark> ䷠<mark>**䷡**</mark> ䷢<mark>**䷣**</mark> ䷤<mark>**䷥**</mark> ䷦<mark>**䷧**</mark> ䷨<mark>**䷩**</mark> ䷪<mark>**䷫**</mark> ䷬<mark>**䷭**</mark> ䷮<mark>**䷯**</mark> ䷰<mark>**䷱**</mark> ䷲<mark>**䷳**</mark> ䷴<mark>**䷵**</mark> ䷶<mark>**䷷**</mark> ䷸<mark>**䷹**</mark> ䷺<mark>**䷻**</mark> ䷼䷽ ䷾<mark>**䷿**</mark><br>
Pairs: 3↔4, 5↔6, 7↔8, 9↔10, 11↔12, 13↔14, 15↔16, 17↔18, 19↔20, 21↔22, 23↔24, 25↔26, 31↔32, 33↔34, 35↔36, 37↔38, 39↔40, 41↔42, 43↔44, 45↔46, 47↔48, 49↔50, 51↔52, 53↔54, 55↔56, 57↔58, 59↔60, 63↔64

Pairs: 1↔2, 27↔28, 29↔30, 61↔62

### Rule 2: No 5-line jumps

When you move from one hexagram to the next, some number of lines change (1 through 6). This is called the [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance). In the King Wen sequence, the number 5 never appears — no two consecutive hexagrams differ by exactly 5 lines.

Examples from the King Wen sequence:

| Lines changed | Transition | Example |
|:---:|---|---|
| 1 | ䷳ Keeping Still #52 → ䷴ Development #53 | `100100` → `110100` |
| 2 | ䷁ The Receptive #2 → ䷂ Difficulty at the Beginning #3 | `000000` → `010001` |
| 3 | ䷅ Conflict #6 → ䷆ The Army #7 | `111010` → `000010` |
| 4 | ䷂ Difficulty at the Beginning #3 → ䷃ Youthful Folly #4 | `010001` → `100010` |
| **5** | **(never occurs in King Wen)** | |
| 6 | ䷀ The Creative #1 → ䷁ The Receptive #2 | `111111` → `000000` |

The difference wave — each character represents one transition, height proportional to lines changed (1-6):

`█▂▅▅▅▃▂▅▂▅█▂▂▅▂▂█▃▅▃▂▂▂▃▅▂█▂█▃▂▃▅▅▅▂▅█▅▃▂▅▂▃▅▃▂▃▅▅▅▁█▂▂▃▅▃▂▁█▃█`

The tallest blocks (█) are distance 6. The shortest (▁) are distance 1. No block reaches height 5 (▅) — that transition never occurs. See [all 63 transitions](#appendix-all-63-transitions) in the appendix.

**What this does:** Eliminates about 96% of the remaining arrangements.

<a id="rule-3"></a>
### Rule 3: Opposites kept unusually close

Every hexagram has an "opposite" — the one where every solid line becomes broken and vice versa. In the King Wen sequence, opposites are placed significantly closer together than you'd expect by chance. If you shuffled randomly, opposites would average about 22 positions apart. In King Wen, they average only 12.1 — at the **3.9th percentile** (only 3.9% of valid orderings place complements closer). King Wen doesn't just happen to have complements nearby; it actively keeps them as close as possible.

To illustrate: King Wen's worst complement pair (䷂ #3 and ䷱ #50, distance 47) is better than most random orderings' average case (~22).

**What this does:** Eliminates about 93% of what's left after Rule 2.

Closest complements highlighted (distance 1 — adjacent in the sequence):<br>
<mark>**䷀䷁**</mark> ䷂䷃ ䷄䷅ ䷆䷇ ䷈䷉ <mark>**䷊䷋**</mark> ䷌䷍ ䷎䷏ <mark>**䷐䷑**</mark> ䷒䷓ ䷔䷕ ䷖䷗ ䷘䷙ <mark>**䷚䷛**</mark> <mark>**䷜䷝**</mark> ䷞䷟ ䷠䷡ ䷢䷣ ䷤<mark>**䷥**</mark> <mark>**䷦**</mark>䷧ ䷨䷩ ䷪䷫ ䷬䷭ ䷮䷯ ䷰䷱ ䷲䷳ <mark>**䷴䷵**</mark> ䷶䷷ ䷸䷹ ䷺䷻ <mark>**䷼䷽**</mark> <mark>**䷾䷿**</mark><br>
Pairs: 1↔2, 11↔12, 17↔18, 27↔28, 29↔30, 38↔39, 53↔54, 61↔62, 63↔64

10 of 32 complement pairs sit directly next to each other. The farthest apart are ䷂ #3 and ䷱ #50 (distance 47) — but the average is only 12.1. See [all 32 complement pairs](#appendix-all-32-complement-pairs-by-distance) in the appendix.

Farthest complements highlighted (䷂ #3 and ䷱ #50, 47 positions apart):<br>
䷀䷁ <mark>**䷂**</mark>䷃ ䷄䷅ ䷆䷇ ䷈䷉ ䷊䷋ ䷌䷍ ䷎䷏ ䷐䷑ ䷒䷓ ䷔䷕ ䷖䷗ ䷘䷙ ䷚䷛ ䷜䷝ ䷞䷟ ䷠䷡ ䷢䷣ ䷤䷥ ䷦䷧ ䷨䷩ ䷪䷫ ䷬䷭ ䷮䷯ ䷰<mark>**䷱**</mark> ䷲䷳ ䷴䷵ ䷶䷷ ䷸䷹ ䷺䷻ ䷼䷽ ䷾䷿<br>
Pair: 3↔50

### Rule 4: It starts with Heaven and Earth

The sequence begins with the two most extreme hexagrams: all solid lines (䷀ The Creative #1, representing Heaven) followed by all broken lines (䷁ The Receptive #2, representing Earth).

**What this does:** Eliminates another 98%.

<mark>**䷀䷁**</mark> ䷂䷃ ䷄䷅ ䷆䷇ ䷈䷉ ䷊䷋ ䷌䷍ ䷎䷏ ䷐䷑ ䷒䷓ ䷔䷕ ䷖䷗ ䷘䷙ ䷚䷛ ䷜䷝ ䷞䷟ ䷠䷡ ䷢䷣ ䷤䷥ ䷦䷧ ䷨䷩ ䷪䷫ ䷬䷭ ䷮䷯ ䷰䷱ ䷲䷳ ䷴䷵ ䷶䷷ ䷸䷹ ䷺䷻ ䷼䷽ ䷾䷿

### Rule 5: Specific transition counts

The "jumps" between consecutive hexagrams follow a specific recipe — called the [difference wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna#Novelty_theory_and_Timewave_Zero): exactly 2 jumps of size 1, 20 jumps of size 2, 13 jumps of size 3, 19 jumps of size 4, and 9 jumps of size 6. No jumps of size 0 or 5.

**What this does:** After all previous rules, a backtracking enumeration (`solve.c`, 10 trillion nodes partitioned across parallel threads) finds hundreds of millions of valid orderings — an enormous reduction from 10^89, but far more than the "near-unique" result suggested by earlier [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) sampling. Canonical counts as of 2026-04-18: **706,422,987** at the depth-3 partition, **286,357,503** at depth-2. The count depends on which partition strategy samples the search space; under true exhaustive enumeration both would converge.

### What the rules determine — and what remains open

Canonical enumerations using `solve.c` at the 10T node budget find hundreds of millions of unique orderings satisfying Rules 1-5. At the depth-3 partition (158,364 sub-branches): **706,422,987**. At depth-2 (3,030 sub-branches): **286,357,503**. Both enumerations are partial in the sense that each sub-branch hits its per-sub-branch node budget rather than completing naturally — so the true count under exhaustive enumeration is unknown and likely larger. Only Position 1 (Creative/Receptive) is universally locked — the same pair appears in every valid ordering. The remaining 31 positions show a gradient of constraint:

| Positions | Pairs observed | KW match rate | Character |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 | 1 | 100% | Fully determined |
| 3-18 | at least 2 each | 87-99% | Highly constrained |
| 19-20 | at least 2-4 | ~50% | Moderately constrained |
| 21-32 | at least 7-16 each | 10-22% | Progressively free |
| 2 | at least 16 | 0.2% | Branch-dependent |

**Caveats on these rates:** The match rates are computed from a partial, non-uniform sample. Each search branch was explored to an unknown depth (none completed), so shallower solutions are overrepresented. The "at least N pairs" counts are lower bounds — a complete enumeration could reveal additional pairs at each position. The rates should be treated as indicative, not definitive.

Earlier analysis based on a partial sample (438 solutions from a single search branch) claimed 23 of 32 positions were locked and that two adjacency constraints sufficed for uniqueness. The larger enumeration reveals this was an artifact of undersampling. The constraint gradient is real but much more nuanced.

Among 6 billion C3-valid solutions (including orientation variants), only 0.0018% satisfy both legacy adjacency constraints (C6+C7). Note: this rate mixes orientation variants (~297 per unique ordering) with unique orderings, so the per-ordering rate would differ. These constraints significantly narrow the space but their sufficiency for uniqueness is unverified at scale.

**What makes King Wen unique among millions of valid orderings is an open question.** It is equally possible that additional mathematical rules exist to be discovered, or that King Wen is simply one choice among many with no further mathematical distinction.

### The millions of roads not taken

The millions of alternative arrangements satisfying Rules 1-5 are not random — they share strong structural similarities with King Wen, especially in the first half of the sequence. The closest non-King-Wen solutions differ by only 2 pair positions, always in the last third (positions 26-32). This means:

- **Position 1 is mathematically forced.** Creative/Receptive always comes first.
- **Position 2 partially constrains positions 3-19, but not deterministically.** Earlier docs claimed "for 16 of 31 branches, positions 3-19 are fully locked" (based on `--prove-cascade`). That result is correct *only within the shift-pattern subspace* (where every position is restricted to KW's pair or the previous pair) — and the canonical analyses show this subspace is a shrinking minority of valid orderings: **2.69% at d2, 0.062% at d3**. In the full canonical datasets, every reachable first-level branch admits multiple distinct pair sequences at positions 3-19; none are uniquely determined. The cascade region is heavily constrained (per-position entropy 0.3-1.9 bits at d3, well below the 5-bit maximum) but not deterministic.
- **Freedom is concentrated in the back half but spread across the cascade too.** The canonical analyses show position 3 has the highest freedom (d3: 4.52 bits, d2: 4.05 bits, 28-31 distinct pairs observed), positions 22-31 carry 3.40-3.54 bits each at d3 (14 distinct pairs), and the "cascade region" (5-20) carries 0.48-1.85 bits each at d3 — heavily constrained but not zero. The traditional [Xugua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Wings) commentary explaining why specific hexagrams follow each other in the back half is describing the designers' choices among genuinely available alternatives, not mathematical necessity.
- **King Wen keeps complements close.** Among all valid orderings, King Wen **minimizes** complement distance — keeping opposites as close as possible. Only 3.9% of valid orderings place complements closer.
- **The starting orientation is forced.** ䷀ The Creative must come before ䷁ The Receptive in all valid arrangements.
- **Within-pair orientation has no rule.** Which hexagram comes first within each pair follows no consistent pattern — not yang count, not binary value, not trigram weight. It appears to be a free choice at each pair.

## What this means

Five constraints, discoverable through analysis, narrow 10^89 possible arrangements to hundreds of millions (d3 canonical: 706M; d2 canonical: 286M). Position 1 is fully determined. The cascade region (positions 3-20) is heavily constrained (per-position entropy 0.3-1.9 bits at d3 — far below the 5-bit maximum) but not deterministic: every first-level branch admits multiple distinct pair sequences across positions 3-19. Positions 22-31 have substantially more freedom (entropy 3.4-3.5 bits at d3). The rules were extracted from King Wen (confirmatory analysis, not independent prediction), but the constraint structure they reveal is genuine.

Someone, roughly [3,000 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou), designed an arrangement of 64 symbols that satisfies a set of interlocking mathematical constraints so strict that only hundreds of millions of arrangements in the entire universe of 10^89 possibilities can satisfy them all. Exactly **4 boundary constraints** (specifying which pairs must be adjacent at 4 specific positions) are needed to narrow those millions to exactly 1 — King Wen. **The 4-boundary minimum is proven at both d2 and d3 scales** (exhaustive 3-subset testing confirms no triple suffices at either partition depth).

**A key partition-scope finding** (2026-04-19): the *specific* boundaries that work are **partition-dependent**. What IS stable across d2 and d3: boundaries **{25, 27}** are mandatory in every working 4-set. What is NOT stable: the other 2 boundaries.

- **d2 10T** (286M): 4 working 4-subsets — `{25, 27} ∪ one-of-{2, 3} ∪ one-of-{21, 22}`.
- **d3 10T** (706M): 8 working 4-subsets — `{25, 27}` plus pairs drawn from `{1..6}` (specifically {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {2,5}, {3,4}, {3,5}, {3,6}).

**Only {25, 27} can be cited as the stable "mandatory boundaries" result.** The broader phrasing about "one-of-{2,3} ∪ one-of-{21,22}" is a d2-specific statement — at deeper partition sampling, different early-zone boundaries become interchangeable. This is exactly the kind of partition-depth sensitivity the null-model caveat (see [CRITIQUE.md](CRITIQUE.md)) anticipates: structural claims that look specific at one partition may look different at another.

### Per-position constraint strength (Shannon entropy)

Across the canonical datasets, the Shannon entropy H(p) of the pair distribution at each position p quantifies how much "choice" exists at that position (in bits; max possible is log₂(32) = 5.0 bits if any pair were equally likely). Values below are from the d3 10T canonical dataset (706M orderings):

| Positions | H (bits) | Character |
|-----------|---------:|-----------|
| 1 | 0.00 | Fully determined (only Creative/Receptive) |
| 2 | 3.83 | Near-free (28 distinct pairs observed) |
| 3 | 4.12 | Most free of all positions (31 pairs observed) |
| 4-20 | 0.28 – 1.72 | Highly constrained — the "cascade region" |
| 21 | 1.71 | Transition |
| 22-31 | 3.45 – 3.65 | Moderately free |
| 32 | 2.66 | Partial constraint (7 pairs) |

Mean H = 2.05 bits per position. The peak at position 3 (not position 2) is because the solver's enumeration fixes position 2 first, so freedom is pushed one step downstream. The cascade region (positions 4-20) carries only 0.3-1.7 bits each — a very different regime from the "free" regions above and below it.

### How positions relate to one another (mutual information)

Pairwise mutual information I(p; q) measures how much knowing the pair at position p reduces uncertainty about position q. The strongest correlations are between adjacent positions in the cascade region (e.g., position 19 ↔ 20 = 1.15 bits), reflecting the tight local propagation. Notably: **boundaries 25 and 27 — both mandatory — have weak mutual information with everything else** (max I ≈ 0.19 bits).

Per-boundary conditional entropy on d3 (`analyze_d3.log` section [18]) directly quantifies how much fixing a boundary to match KW reduces total sequence uncertainty (baseline: 73.17 bits across 32 positions). The most informative boundaries are the early ones: boundary 4 contributes 46.8 bits of information, boundary 5 contributes 42.7 bits, boundary 6 contributes 39.7 bits. **Boundaries 25 and 27 sit mid-pack at 9.96 and 10.64 bits** — roughly one-fifth the information content of the top boundaries. Yet they are mandatory while the high-information boundaries are interchangeable. What makes `{25, 27}` mandatory is not that they carry more information but that the information they carry is **structurally independent** of all other boundaries: they eliminate non-KW solutions that no combination of other boundaries can reach.

### Boundary redundancy and independence

Joint-survivor analysis (counting how many solutions match KW at *both* of two given boundaries simultaneously) reveals two distinct boundary clusters:

- **Boundaries 15-19 are fully redundant.** For every pair within this set, `joint(b1, b2) = min(survivors(b1), survivors(b2))` — knowing one of these boundaries implies all the others. The cascade region propagates so tightly that constraints near its end carry overlapping information.
- **Boundaries 26 and 27 are highly independent of the cascade region.** Joint/min-single ratios with cascade-region boundaries (3-8) are 0.007-0.010 — essentially uncorrelated. This is what makes them structurally valuable in the minimum-boundary set: they eliminate solutions that the cascade region cannot.

This explains why a minimum 4-set like {2, 21, 25, 27} (d2's greedy pick) or {1, 4, 25, 27} (d3's greedy pick) works: early boundaries catch the high-entropy choices in the front zone, and 25 and 27 contribute *independent* information not implied by any other boundary. The specific early-zone picks vary by partition depth; the mandatory-status of {25, 27} does not.

### Within-pair orient freedom: a constraint-geometry finding (not KW-specific)

King Wen appears exactly once per canonical dataset (d3: 1 variant, d2: 1 variant — the canonical dedup keeps the lex-smallest orient variant per pair-sequence). Earlier 742M-era analysis found 4 KW orient variants with coupling at positions {2, 3, 28, 29, 30}; the canonical format v1 with per-canonical-class dedup collapses these to 1. The pair-sequence is the invariant; orient variants are cheaply recoverable by testing 2^31 combinations. Running the orient-coupling generalization analysis (`--analyze` section [14]) across the canonical datasets shows:

In the canonical v1 format, each pair-ordering appears exactly once (lex-smallest orient variant kept; other variants cheaply recoverable by testing 2^31 combinations). The d3 10T dataset contains 706,422,987 unique pair-orderings; the d2 10T dataset contains 286,357,503. The 742M-era "4 KW orient variants" finding was an artifact of pre-format-v1 storage that stored all orient variants rather than collapsing them.

The underlying constraint geometry — that within-pair orient is almost entirely forced across positions 5-20 for every valid pair-sequence — is unchanged. What changes is the STORAGE: canonical format v1 doesn't duplicate-store the orient variants that exist, it stores the canonical form + the implicit fact that some pair-orderings have multiple valid orient variants which could be regenerated on demand.

## An important caveat

Applying the same methodology to random pair-constrained sequences — extract their diff distribution, complement distance, and starting pair, then test for uniqueness — also produces apparent uniqueness in 9 out of 10 cases. **The constraint extraction approach makes almost any sequence appear uniquely determined.** This means Rules 3-7 are not individually remarkable — any sequence's specific properties would similarly narrow the search space.

What IS genuinely special about King Wen is **Rules 1 and 2**: the perfect pair structure and the no-5-line-transition property. Only ~4% of pair-constrained orderings avoid 5-line transitions (ROAE's 10^9-sample pair-constrained null gives 4.29% precisely). The pair structure itself is vanishingly unlikely by chance — a random 64-permutation has probability ~10^-44 of satisfying it. Both observations are **prior knowledge** — Rule 1 is classical (*Yi Zhuan* commentary, Cook 2006) and Rule 2 is from McKenna & McKenna 1975 (*The Invisible Landscape*). ROAE's contribution is **independent computational verification** at scale, plus **null-model testing** across seven structured permutation families showing no family other than KW simultaneously satisfies C1+C2+C3. See [CITATIONS.md](CITATIONS.md) and [CRITIQUE.md](CRITIQUE.md) §Missing analyses.

## What we can and cannot say

The analysis shows the King Wen sequence satisfies a set of interlocking mathematical constraints. It cannot show whether the designers understood those constraints explicitly or arrived at them through centuries of refinement. A simple practice — "pair each hexagram with its mirror, keep opposites nearby, avoid jarring transitions" — applied consistently over generations could produce the same result as deliberate mathematical design. The sequence is the same either way; only the history differs, and the history is outside the reach of computation.

## Impact and scientific implications

ROAE's contribution to the study of the King Wen sequence — distinct from what was previously known — is primarily about **quantifying** how specific and KW-distinctive the combined constraint system is, and about **reproducibility** of that quantification.

**What was already known** ([CITATIONS.md](CITATIONS.md)):

- The pair structure (Rule 1) is ancient, discussed in *Yi Zhuan* commentary (5th–3rd c. BCE), formalized in modern combinatorial terms in **Cook 2006** (*Classical Chinese Combinatorics*).
- The no-5-line-transition property (Rule 2) is documented in **McKenna & McKenna 1975** (*The Invisible Landscape*).

**What ROAE adds:**

1. **Exhaustive enumeration at scale.** Under the conjoined C1 + C2 + C3 constraint system, ROAE counts **706,422,987** distinct orderings at a 10 trillion-node partial enumeration (10T d3; sha `f7b8c4fb…`). The count is exact, reproducible byte-identically across hardware and region, and was previously only estimated or approximated.

2. **Seven-family null-model framework.** Measures how other structured permutation families compare to KW's structural properties. Main finding: zero of 1.86 billion permutations across six unconditional families satisfy C1 (consistent with the theoretical rate of ~10⁻⁴⁴ for random permutations). For the de Bruijn and Gray code families, 0% is also proved analytically, not just observed. This is the first systematic null-model test of this scope for the KW structural constraints.

3. **C1 does most of the structural work.** A 10⁹-sample pair-constrained null (C1 guaranteed by construction) shows that given C1, the conditional C2 hit rate jumps from 0.18% (random) to 4.29% (a 23.5× multiplier), and C3 from 0.003% to 6.42% (a 2,264× multiplier). This quantifies what was previously intuitive: the pair structure is doing the heavy lifting; C2 and C3 are relatively modest additional filters.

4. **C3 (complement-distance ceiling of 776) as a specifically quantified constraint.** Believed ROAE-original; if prior work exists, please see [CITATIONS.md](CITATIONS.md).

5. **Mawangdui comparison.** New observation (surfaced during null-model testing): the ancient Mawangdui silk-text ordering (168 BCE) **accidentally satisfies C2** (zero 5-line transitions) despite failing C1 and C3. Mawangdui and KW — the two major documented hexagram orderings — share Hamming-distance structure but diverge on pair geometry and complement placement. To this author's knowledge, this comparative finding is not previously documented.

6. **Latin-square C2-rate decomposition.** The 8! × 8! Latin-square row × column traversal family has a surprisingly high C2 rate (57.96%). ROAE provides an analytic decomposition that reproduces this rate exactly from first principles: only 7 of 63 transitions in a Latin-square traversal can be 5-line, and the rate is controlled by the row-permutation's Hamming profile (Hamiltonian path in the 3-cube) combined with the column-permutation's first-last XOR. See [CRITIQUE.md §Latin-square C2-rate decomposition](CRITIQUE.md).

7. **Partition Invariance theorem.** A formal guarantee ([PARTITION_INVARIANCE.md](PARTITION_INVARIANCE.md)) that the canonical solutions.bin sha256 is byte-identical across any choice of hardware, thread count, region, merge algorithm, or enumeration path — for fixed solver + input parameters. Cross-validated across the "4 corners": {Zen 4 F64 westus2, Zen 5 D128 westus3} × {external merge, in-memory heap-sort}.

**Open questions this work surfaces:** see [CRITIQUE.md §Open questions](CRITIQUE.md). In brief: Costas arrays at order 64 remain untested (infeasible at 64! candidates); Latin-square's 57.96% C2 rate invites parallel analysis of whether KW's own adjacency geometry has an analogous within/between decomposition; whether any published order-64 Costas arrays accidentally satisfy C1+C2+C3 is a concrete follow-up.

## Appendix: All 32 complement pairs by distance

Visualization of [Rule 3 (Opposites stay close)](#rule-3). Each line shows the King Wen sequence with one complement pair highlighted. Sorted from closest (distance 1 — adjacent) to farthest (distance 47). The mean across all 32 pairs is 12.1.

Close complement pairs (distance 1-7) are always in the same half of the sequence. Far complement pairs (distance 19+) always cross the midpoint. No exceptions. (Note: some distance groups show highlights on both sides — e.g., distance 6 has four pairs, two in the first half and two in the second. Each individual pair stays in its own half.)

Multi-pair distances always come in groups of 2 (e.g., 5↔35 AND 6↔36). This is because complementation maps King Wen pairs to King Wen pairs: if A and reverse(A) form a pair, then complement(A) and complement(reverse(A)) also form a pair. So both members of one pair always point to members of the same other pair, at the same distance.

## Appendix: All 63 transitions in the King Wen sequence

Every consecutive hexagram transition, showing the number of lines that change
([Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)).
A distance of 5 never occurs — this is [Rule 2](#rule-2-no-5-line-jumps).

The difference wave as a sparkline (each character = one transition, height = lines changed):

`█▂▅▅▅▃▂▅▂▅█▂▂▅▂▂█▃▅▃▂▂▂▃▅▂█▂█▃▂▃▅▅▅▂▅█▅▃▂▅▂▃▅▃▂▃▅▅▅▁█▂▂▃▅▃▂▁█▃█`

**The difference wave** — the sequence of Hamming distances read left to right:

`6 2 4 4 4 3 2 4 2 4 6 2 2 4 2 2 6 3 4 3 2 2 2 3 4 2 6 2 6 3 2 3 4 4 4 2 4 6 4 3 2 4 2 3 4 3 2 3 4 4 4 1 6 2 2 3 4 3 2 1 6 3 6`

**Transition counts:** 1: 2, 2: 20, 3: 13, 4: 19, **5: 0 (never)**, 6: 9
